# Development Branching strategy: Case-Branch

## Branching

- When you start a new story/task
- Create a Branch with the following format:

  <Developer initials>_<Story_name>_<Sprint_Number>

Pull Request into development when the story is done. This pull request must be reviewed by
at least 1 other developer before being merged.

After each Sprint, merge into release branch / Master branch.
